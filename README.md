Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è
Programming Language: Python 3.10+

Core Telegram Library: Telethon

Artificial Intelligence:

Access to various models via OpenRouter API

SpeechRecognition library for STT (with Google Web Speech API)

OpenAI Python library (for interacting with OpenRouter, which has an OpenAI-compatible API)

Audio Processing: Pydub (for audio format conversion)

Configuration Management: configparser

Date & Time Handling: pytz, datetime

Setup and Installation üöÄ
Prerequisites
Python: Version 3.10 or higher. Download from the official Python website.

FFmpeg: Required by pydub for audio processing (essential for the STT feature). FFmpeg must be installed on your system and accessible via the system's PATH, or its path must be specified in the config.ini file. Installation guides can be found on the official FFmpeg website.

Telegram Account: To obtain api_id and api_hash.

Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd SakaiBot

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended):

python -m venv venv

# On Windows

venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux

source venv/bin/activate

Install Required Libraries:
First, you need to create a requirements.txt file. In your activated virtual environment, run the following command to save the list of currently installed packages:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

Note: Ensure that only the project's core libraries are included in this file, not all libraries from your global Python environment. If you've just created the virtual environment and installed only the project dependencies, this command will work correctly.

Once requirements.txt is created, others (or yourself in a new environment) can install all dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
Create a copy of config.ini.example

Fill in config.ini with your details:

[Telegram]:

api_id and api_hash: Obtain these from my.telegram.org.

phone_number: Your Telegram phone number in international format (e.g., +1234567890).

[UserBot]:

session_name: A custom name for the Telegram session file (e.g., sakaibot_session).

max_analyze_messages: Maximum number of messages to fetch for the /analyze command.

[OpenRouter]:

api_key: Your API key from OpenRouter.

model_name: The name of the model you want to use from OpenRouter (e.g., deepseek/deepseek-chat).

[AssemblyAI] (Optional, if implemented):

api_key: Your API key from AssemblyAI.

[API_KEYS] (Optional, if ElevenLabs is implemented):

elevenlabs_api_key: Your API key from ElevenLabs.

[Paths] (Optional):

ffmpeg_executable: The full path to your ffmpeg.exe (or ffmpeg) executable (e.g., C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe). This is not necessary if FFmpeg is in your system's PATH.
