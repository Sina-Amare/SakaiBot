# Telegram User Verification Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a robust user verification system for Sakaibot that fetches user information directly from Telegram during authorization, eliminating dependency on PV cache and ensuring users exist in Telegram before granting access.

## Key Changes

### 1. Telegram User Verifier Module

A new module `src/telegram/user_verifier.py` was created to handle direct verification of Telegram users:

- Fetches user information by ID, username, or name directly from Telegram API
- Implements proper error handling for rate limits and invalid users
- Provides comprehensive user information including ID, display name, username, and additional metadata
- Includes batch verification functionality

### 2. Updated Authorization Flow

The authorization commands in `src/cli/commands/auth.py` were modified to use direct verification:

- **`sakaibot auth add <identifier>`**: Now fetches user directly from Telegram instead of relying on cached PVs
- **`sakaibot auth remove <identifier>`**: Uses direct verification to find users for removal
- **`sakaibot auth list`**: Enhanced to fetch updated user information when not available in cache
- **`sakaibot auth refresh`**: New command to refresh PV cache from Telegram

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- Proper handling of Telegram API rate limits (FloodWaitError)
- Graceful handling of invalid usernames/IDs
- Comprehensive error messages for users
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Commands

### New Commands

- `sakaibot auth refresh` - Refresh PV cache from Telegram

### Updated Commands

- `sakaibot auth add <identifier>` - Now works without requiring PV cache
- `sakaibot auth remove <identifier>` - Now works without requiring PV cache
- `sakaibot auth list` - Now shows updated user information from Telegram when available

## Technical Details

### Direct Verification Process

1. Connect to Telegram using existing session
2. Attempt to fetch user by identifier (ID, username, or name)
3. Verify user exists and is not deleted
4. Format user information consistently
5. Use this information for authorization operations

### Cache Integration

While the system now works without PV cache, it still integrates with existing cache mechanisms:

- Uses cache as fallback when direct verification fails
- Updates cache with new information when available
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing cached data

### Error Scenarios Handled

- Rate limiting by Telegram API
- Invalid user identifiers
- Network connectivity issues
- Deleted or banned users
- API access restrictions

## Benefits

1. **No Cache Dependency**: Authorization commands work without requiring PV cache
2. **Real-time Verification**: User information is fetched directly from Telegram
3. **Improved Reliability**: Reduced dependency on potentially stale cache data
4. **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios
5. **Enhanced Security**: Verifies users exist in Telegram before authorization
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing cache and settings

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests were added in `tests/unit/test_user_verifier.py` covering:

- Successful user verification by ID and username
- Error handling for invalid identifiers
- Rate limiting scenarios
- Batch verification functionality
- Edge cases like deleted users

## Files Modified

- `src/telegram/user_verifier.py` - New module for direct user verification
- `src/cli/commands/auth.py` - Updated authorization commands
- `src/utils/cache.py` - Fixed protocol compatibility issues
- `tests/unit/test_user_verifier.py` - New unit tests

## Migration

The changes are backward compatible - existing authorized users and settings remain intact. The system will gradually update user information as users are accessed through the new verification system.
