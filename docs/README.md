## Document Status

All documents are **complete** and ready for use. They provide:
- ✅ Comprehensive analysis of codebase
- ✅ Deployment readiness assessment
- ✅ Technical debt identification
- ✅ Prioritized action plan
- ✅ Security evaluation
- ✅ Architecture documentation

## Key Findings Summary

**Deployment Readiness Score**: **7.5/10**

**Critical Blockers**:
1. Missing `.env.example` template
2. No Docker configuration
3. No deployment documentation (now addressed)

**Strengths**:
- Well-structured architecture
- Comprehensive testing
- Good error handling
- Modern Python practices

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Deployment infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline
- Some technical debt (hardcoded values)
