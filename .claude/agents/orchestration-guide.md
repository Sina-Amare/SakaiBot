# Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

This guide outlines the three primary orchestration patterns for coordinating multiple Claude agents in complex development tasks.

## Pattern 1: Sequential Processing

**Use Case:** Dependencies between tasks, linear workflows where each step depends on the previous one.

**Structure:**
```
Main Agent → Sub-Agent A → Sub-Agent B → Sub-Agent C → Integration
```

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Research Agent** - Gather requirements and analyze existing code
2. **Architecture Agent** - Design system based on research findings  
3. **Implementation Agent** - Build solution based on architecture
4. **Main Agent** - Integrate results and validate final outcome

**When to Use:**
- Complex feature implementation with clear dependencies
- Migration projects requiring sequential steps
- Bug fixes requiring investigation → diagnosis → implementation → testing

## Pattern 2: Parallel Processing

**Use Case:** Independent tasks that can run simultaneously, time-sensitive projects.

**Structure:**
```
Main Agent → [Sub-Agent A, Sub-Agent B, Sub-Agent C] → Integration
```

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Main Agent** - Break down task into independent components
2. **Parallel Execution:**
   - **Frontend Agent** - UI implementation
   - **Backend Agent** - API development  
   - **Database Agent** - Schema design
   - **DevOps Agent** - Infrastructure setup
3. **Main Agent** - Integrate all components and resolve conflicts

**When to Use:**
- Full-stack feature development
- Multiple independent bug fixes
- Comprehensive code review across multiple files
- Performance optimization across different system layers

## Pattern 3: Hierarchical Processing

**Use Case:** Complex projects requiring coordination between specialized teams.

**Structure:**
```
Main Agent → Team Lead Agent → [Specialist A, Specialist B] → Integration
```

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Main Agent** - High-level planning and oversight
2. **Development Lead Agent** - Coordinate development team
   - **Frontend Specialist** - UI/UX implementation
   - **Backend Specialist** - Server-side logic
3. **QA Lead Agent** - Coordinate quality assurance
   - **Tester Agent** - Test case creation and execution
   - **Security Auditor** - Security review and validation
4. **Main Agent** - Final integration and validation

**When to Use:**
- Large-scale application development
- Enterprise-level refactoring projects  
- Multi-system integration projects
- Compliance and security-critical implementations

## Orchestration Best Practices

### Context Management
- **Early Delegation:** Invoke sub-agents early to preserve main context
- **Task Isolation:** Keep sub-agent tasks focused and well-defined
- **Context Boundaries:** Avoid sharing context between sub-agents
- **Result Integration:** Consolidate sub-agent outputs effectively

### Task Delegation Strategy
- **Clear Instructions:** Provide specific, actionable tasks to sub-agents
- **Tool Restrictions:** Limit tools based on agent responsibilities
- **Outcome Definition:** Clearly define expected deliverables
- **Error Handling:** Plan for sub-agent failures and recovery

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel When Possible:** Use parallel processing for independent tasks
- **Sequential When Required:** Use sequential for dependent operations
- **Resource Management:** Monitor token usage across agents
- **Caching:** Reuse sub-agent insights across similar tasks

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development (Parallel Pattern)
```
Task: "Implement user authentication system"

Main Agent:
├── Frontend Agent → Login/Register UI components
├── Backend Agent → Authentication API endpoints  
├── Database Agent → User schema and migrations
└── Security Agent → Security review and hardening

Integration: Main Agent combines all components
```

### Example 2: Bug Investigation (Sequential Pattern)
```
Task: "Fix performance issue in user dashboard"

Main Agent:
→ Debugger Agent → Identify root cause
→ Performance Optimizer → Design optimization strategy
→ Implementation Agent → Apply fixes
→ Tester Agent → Validate solution

Integration: Main Agent verifies complete resolution
```

### Example 3: System Migration (Hierarchical Pattern)
```
Task: "Migrate legacy system to microservices"

Main Agent:
├── Architecture Lead
│   ├── System Designer → Service boundaries
│   └── Database Architect → Data migration strategy
├── Development Lead  
│   ├── Backend Specialist → Service implementation
│   └── Frontend Specialist → UI updates
└── Operations Lead
    ├── DevOps Specialist → Deployment pipeline
    └── Monitoring Specialist → Observability setup

Integration: Main Agent coordinates across all teams
```

## Choosing the Right Pattern

### Sequential Processing
- ✅ Use when tasks have clear dependencies
- ✅ Use for linear workflows (research → design → implement)
- ❌ Avoid when tasks can be parallelized
- ❌ Avoid for time-critical projects

### Parallel Processing  
- ✅ Use for independent tasks
- ✅ Use when speed is important
- ✅ Use for full-stack development
- ❌ Avoid when tasks have dependencies
- ❌ Avoid when coordination overhead is high

### Hierarchical Processing
- ✅ Use for complex, multi-team projects
- ✅ Use when coordination is critical
- ✅ Use for enterprise-scale implementations
- ❌ Avoid for simple tasks
- ❌ Avoid when team leads add unnecessary overhead

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Development Velocity:** Story points completed per sprint
- **Context Preservation:** Reduced context switching overhead
- **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of successfully completed sub-tasks

### Quality Metrics
- **Code Quality:** Reduced review iterations and bug rates
- **Integration Success:** Successful combination of sub-agent outputs
- **Error Recovery:** Successful handling of sub-agent failures

### Resource Metrics
- **Token Usage:** Efficient context management across agents
- **Processing Time:** Total time from task start to completion
- **Agent Utilization:** Effective use of specialized agents

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Orchestration
- Too many layers of coordination
- Unnecessary sub-agent delegation
- Complex workflows for simple tasks

### Under-Coordination
- Insufficient communication between agents
- Conflicting implementations from parallel agents
- Missing integration and validation steps

### Context Pollution
- Sharing too much context between agents
- Mixing concerns across agent boundaries
- Inefficient context management

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Sub-Agent Failures
1. **Identify Failure Point** - Determine which agent failed and why
2. **Assess Impact** - Understand effect on overall workflow
3. **Recovery Strategy** - Retry, reassign, or modify approach
4. **Prevention** - Adjust instructions to prevent similar failures

### Integration Issues
1. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle conflicting outputs from parallel agents
2. **Missing Dependencies** - Ensure all required inputs are available
3. **Quality Validation** - Verify integrated solution meets requirements
4. **Rollback Strategy** - Plan for integration failure recovery

This orchestration framework enables teams to leverage the 90%+ performance improvements documented in multi-agent research while maintaining code quality and project coherence.
