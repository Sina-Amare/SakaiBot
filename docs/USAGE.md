   ```

4. Follow the authentication process to connect your Telegram account

## Basic Usage

```
Would you like to:
 [1] üéõÔ∏è  Interactive Menu (navigate with numbers)
  [2] üìä Show Status (default)

```

Select option 1 to access the interactive menu system where you can:

- View and manage private chats

### Using Command Line Interface

You can also use SakaiBot directly through command-line commands:

```bash

```

## Telegram Commands

Once your bot is running and monitoring is active, you can use various commands in Telegram:

### AI Commands

#### `/prompt` - Custom AI Queries

Ask the AI anything using this command:

- Usage: `/prompt=your question or instruction`
- Example: `/prompt=Explain quantum computing in simple terms`

#### `/translate` - Translation with Phonetics

Translate text with Persian phonetic pronunciation:

- Usage: `/translate=language [text]` or reply to a message with `/translate=language`
- Example: `/translate=Persian Hello, how are you?`
- Provides both translation and phonetic pronunciation

#### `/analyze` - Conversation Analysis

Analyze recent conversation history:

- Usage: `/analyze=number_of_messages`
- Example: `/analyze=50` (analyzes last 50 messages)
- Provides detailed summaries and insights

#### `/tellme` - Question Answering

Ask questions based on recent chat history:

- Usage: `/tellme=number_of_messages=your_question`
- Example: `/tellme=10=What did John say about the project?`

### Speech Commands

#### `/stt` - Speech-to-Text

Convert voice messages to text:

- Reply to a voice message with `/stt`
- The bot will transcribe the voice message and provide an AI summary

#### `/tts` or `/speak` - Text-to-Speech

Convert text to voice messages:

- Usage: `/tts [params] <text>` or reply to a text message with `/tts [params]`
- Parameters: `voice=<voice_id>`, `rate=<¬±N%>`, `volume=<¬±N%>`
- Example: `/tts voice=en-US-JennyNeural rate=-10% Hello world`

### Categorization Commands

When configured with categorization settings, you can use commands to forward messages to specific topics:

- Use custom commands like `/work`, `/personal`, etc. when replying to messages
- Messages will be forwarded to the configured topic in your target group

#### Forum Group Mapping

For forum groups, you can set up specific command-to-topic mappings using the CLI:

1. Set your target forum group:

   ```bash
   sakaibot group set "your_forum_group"
   ```

2. Map commands to specific topics:

   ```bash
   sakaibot group map --add
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter a command and select a topic for it.

3. Multiple commands can be mapped to the same topic, allowing for flexible categorization:

   - `/help` and `/support` can both map to a "Support" topic
   - `/news` and `/updates` can both map to an "Announcements" topic

4. List current mappings:
   ```bash
   sakaibot group map --list
   ```

When you send a command (like `/help`) in reply to a message, the bot will forward that message to the corresponding topic in your forum group.

## Managing Your Setup
